Facing one of the most challenging pandemics for organizational modus operandi (COVID-19), organizations are struggling for operational and strategic support. The adoption of remote work (RW) is increasing. For economic reasons, competitive advantage, or even as a pandemic response (business continuity plan), RW is a domain worth further investigation. However, the literature lacks insight regarding RW adoption. A design science research methodology was adopted, including a systematic literature review to elicit RW advantages, disadvantages, challenges and driving forces, as well as their relation. To evaluate and demonstrate findings, 129 qualitative interviews were performed with RW professionals. In the end, 57 decision factors were elicited, and 16 relations were validated. The authors concluded that cost-reduction and flexibility to promote work–life balance is the most positive outputs, while communication and technical problems, as well as management issues, are what most concerns professionals. Moreover, positive relations are more recognized among professionals over negative ones.}

abstract = {Service and social robot in public scenarios will face various tasks in future applications, such as guiding people or admonishing them to provide assistance or convey social norms. Robots in public spaces might also incorporate roles of authority figures who might admonish people (e.g., security or guard robots). However, recent investigations showed that people ignore the admonishment of robots. Thus, in this work, we are looking at the reasons why people might ignore robots based on the Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT). We present the results of two consecutive field observations where a robot admonishes participants (i.e., pedestrians in a shopping mall) and requests them to stop using a smartphone while walking, which is considered an unmoral behavior. In the first field observation, we approached 160 participants over four days and conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 of them. Approximately half of the people ignored the robot, and half of them followed the instructions. Our interview results show that people who ignore the robot indeed use trivialization as a cognitive dissonance reduction strategy to justify ignoring the robot. Based on our analysis of the results, we developed a counter-trivialization strategy that anticipates this dissonance reduction strategy. We admonished 167 participants in our second field observation over four days, and our results show that significantly fewer people ignore the instructions of the robot when the robot uses a counter-trivialization strategy.},

abstract = {Telepresence technology creates the opportunity for people that were traditionally left out of the workforce to work remotely. In the service industry, a pool of novice remote workers could teleoperate robots to perform short work stints to fill in the gaps left by the dwindling workforce. A hurdle is that consistently talking appropriately and politely imposes a severe mental burden on such novice operators and the quality of the service may suffer. In this study, we propose a teleoperation support system that lets novice remote workers talk freely without considering appropriateness and politeness while maintaining the quality of the service. The proposed system exploits intent recognition to transform casual utterances into predefined appropriate and polite utterances. We conducted a within subject user study where 23 participants played the role of novice remote operators controlling a guardsman robot in charge of monitoring customers’ behaviors. We measured the workload with and without using the proposed support system using NASA task load index questionnaires. The workload was significantly lower&nbsp;(p <.001) when using the proposed support system&nbsp;(M = 46.07, SD = 14.36) than when not using it&nbsp;(M = 62.74, SD = 12.70). The effect size was large&nbsp;(Cohen’s d = 1.23).},

abstract = {In this paper we explore the persuasive effects of social feedback, as provided by an embodied agent, on behavioral change. In a lab setting, two experiments were conducted in which participants had the opportunity to conserve energy while carrying out washing tasks with a simulated washing machine. The experiments tested the effect of positive and negative social feedback and compared these effects to more widely used factual feedback. Results of both studies indicate that social feedback has stronger persuasive effects than factual feedback (Experiment 1) and factual-evaluative feedback (Experiment 2). In addition, an effect of feedback valence was found, demonstrating more conservation actions following negative feedback (social or factual) as compared to positive feedback. Interestingly, especially negative social feedback had the strongest persuasive effects. The predicted perceived agency effect could not be demonstrated. These findings have several implications for theory and design of persuasive robotic agents.},
